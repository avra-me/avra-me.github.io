#### Projects Undertaken

###### Project Rewire

* Supported the delivery of a University wide upgrade to their LMS (Canvas) by creating integrations between the existing services and the new LMS. 

###### Project Passport

* Responsible for delivering an upgraded single sign on experience to all RMIT applications.
* Built a suite during quiet periods at work to automate a manual process that was being performed. Wrote up extensive documentation and handed the solution over to the BAU team.

#### Achievements

* During Project Rewire a high priority outage caused several thousand students to lose access to their LMS. As the leadership team were overseas, I took control of the situation and designed and developed a solution. I was recognised by leadership for building a rapid solution with no support.
