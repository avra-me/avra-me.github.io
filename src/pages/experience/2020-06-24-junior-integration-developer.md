### Projects Undertaken

I spent most of my degree at RMIT university working for the technology services department supporting the delivery of university-wide projects.

#### Project Rewire

* Supported the delivery of a University wide upgrade to their LMS (Canvas) by creating integrations between the existing services and the new LMS. 

#### Project Passport

Delivered an upgraded single sign on experience to all RMIT applications.
* Built a suite during quiet periods at work to automate a manual process that was being performed. Wrote up extensive documentation and handed the solution over to the BAU team.

#### Achievements

* During Project Rewire a high priority outage caused 2,000 students to lose access to their LMS. With the leadership team were overseas, I was responsible for and designing and developing a solution. Recognised by leadership for building a rapid solution with no support.
